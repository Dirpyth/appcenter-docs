Migrating Live Workloads
========================

UForge AppCenter offers the capability to migrate a live system. UForge Migration will "deep scan" a live system and report back the meta-data of every file and package that makes up the running workload. It also allows you to change or add individual components prior to the final migration.

The following sub-sections describe in detail the scan steps and the differences between black box and white box migration:
